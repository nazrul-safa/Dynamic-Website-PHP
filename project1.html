													1. Introduction <br>
													In this days the government of Bangladesh is highly emphasizing the digitalization of every field of human life. So it is time when we take our traffic system on a digital level. For this, we came up with an idea of creating a system which will record traffic load on roads and give this information to human to control the traffic system of road.<br>
													2. Description of the project <br>
													In our country, we find that traffic police manually controls vehicles on the road. He waves his hand to start or stop a signal. Sometimes he stops a signal for so long a creates a huge traffic line as he doesn’t know the proper amount of vehicle running on the road at that time. So it often happens that he has stopped a signal so long thinking there is less vehicle on that road rather than others, but in actual that road has flooded with traffic. So here, we are creating a software project which will take footages from surveillance cameras installed by DMP, then detect vehicle and count them. The system takes recorded video footages as input and then detects the vehicles. These detected vehicles are classified into five groups such as Car, Bus, CNG, Pickup, and Truck. After detecting the vehicles, the sytem counts them and categorize in particular groups. The vehicles are counted when they reaches a certain margin of the road. If they enters into the margin line, then the vehicles are counted in for particular group. Thus the system creates certain data of that road at any particular time, which will help humans to make further decisions.<br>

													3. Purpose of Project <br>
													As we know, information is the strongest weapon in the modern world. This project gives us the information on roads which we need to make decision how to manage traffic flow. It creates data which can be used in further decision makaing in how to control traffic, which type of materials should be used to build a road so that it can take the heavy load of vehicles etc.<br>

													4. Introduction:<br>
													In this project we have used so many tool <br>
													1) Computer vision annotation tool (CVAT)<br>
													2)  Docker<br>
													3) Tensorflow<br>
													4) YOLO v2<br>
													5)  CUDA<br>
													6)  Python<br>
													7) Open CV<br>

													5. Description:<br>
 													CVAT annotation tool:<br>
													Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an open-source tool for annotating digital images 
													and videos. The main function of the application is to provide users with convenient annotation 
													instruments. <br>
													CVAT is a browser-based application for both individuals and teams that supports different work 
													scenarios. The main tasks of supervised machine learning can be divided into three groups:<br>
													1.	Object detection<br>
														2.	Image classification<br>
														3.	Image segmentation<br>
														Data annotation in CVAT starts by creating an annotation task with the following instructions:<br>
														1.	Name a task<br>
														2.	Specify labels and their attributes<br>
														3.	Choose files to download<br>

														We have marked five labels Bus, Truck, Car, CNG, and Pickup.  Datasets are loaded from the 
														local file system or a mounted file system inside a container. A task can include one image 
														archive, one video, a set or a catalog of images from shared storage.<br>

														   
														6. CVAT label creation & video upload into annotation tool.<br>

														Then we press the Submit button, and it will be added into the list of annotation tasks. Each link inside the Jobs section corresponds to one segment. We can use four shapes to annotate images: boxes, polygons, polylines, and points.
														When we download annotations from Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) we can choose one of several data formats. We selected PASCAL VOC annotation format for our project. 
														<br>
														 
														7. Video annotation<br>
														There are two modes in CVAT annotation mode and interpolation mode.
														Annotation mode: Attribute Annotation Mode was developed for image classification and accelerates the process of attribute annotation by focusing the annotator’s attention on just one exact attribute. In each image, it is possible to have many different objects. Each object can have multiple attributes.
														Interpolation mode: In interpolation, mode frames are annotated. The annotation contains tracks. Each track corresponds to an object which can be presented on multiple frames. The same object cannot be presented on the same frame in multiple locations. Each location of the object can have multiple attributes even if an attribute is immutable for the object it will be cloned for each location.<br>
														There are several data formal in CVAT. Format selection is possible after clicking on the Upload annotation / Dump annotation button. They are:<br>
														1.	CVAT XML v1.1 for images  <br>     
														2.	CVAT XML v1.1 for a video<br>
														3.	Pascal VOC<br>
														4.	YOLO<br>
														5.	Tyryrtfy<br>
														6.	PNG mask <br>
														7.	PNG instance mask<br>
														8.	MOT<br>
														9.	LabelMe<br>
														10.	TFrecord<br>
														 
														We can use the default TF Annotation models or upload your own to pre-load bounding boxes directly within CVAT.<br>

														4.2.2 Docker:<br>
														Docker Desktop for Windows is Docker designed to run on Windows 10. It is a native Windows application that provides an easy-to-use development environment for building, shipping, and running dockerized apps. Docker Desktop for Windows uses Windows-native Hyper-V virtualization and networking and is the fastest and most reliable way to develop Docker apps on Windows. Docker Desktop for Windows supports running both Linux and Windows Docker containers. We use Docker to install CVAT in our windows. 



														4.2.3 YOLO v2:<br>
														This model is a real-time neural network for object detection that detects 20 different classes. It is made up of 9 convolutional layers and six max-pooling layers and is a smaller version of the more complex full YOLOv2 network. The Tiny YOLO model was trained on the Pascal VOC dataset.
														This network divides the image into regions and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each region. These bounding boxes are weighted by the predicted probabilities.

														The process to train our own dataset:<br>
														Before training the model should be prepared for inferences. To gain a trained model, here are what we did
														<br>
														1.	Create  VOC dataset<br>
														2.	Change configurations to fit the model into your own situation<br>
														3.	Build the model<br>
														4.	Train the model<br>
														First, In our project, we used darkflow (open-sourced project for YOLOv2) and its pre-trained parameters.<br>
														Second, there should be a filev for specifying the model’s configuration. If not, you should change it in the code itself. For darkflow, there is a file (*.cfg) for each model.<br>
														The third and the fourth steps probably different from various implementations. In darkflow, the code below shows how we train our own dataset.<br>
														“python flow --model cfg/tiny-yolo-5c.cfg --load –1 tiny-yolo.weights --train --annotation train/Annotation --dataset train/Images –epoch 100 –gpu 0.8 –-savepb”<br>

														 


														In tiny-yolo-5c.cfg, change classes in the [region] layer (the last layer) to the number of classes you are going to train for. In our case, classes are set to 5.
														We choose to train the data with 100 epoch, an epoch refers to one cycle through the full training dataset.
														<br>


														4.2.4 CUDA:<br>
														CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by NVDIA.  It allows software developers and software engineers to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit (GPU) for general-purpose processing an approach termed GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units). The CUDA platform is a software layer that gives direct access to the GPU's virtual instruction set and parallel computational elements, for the execution of compute kernels. 
														The CUDA Toolkit from NVIDIA provides everything we need to develop GPU-accelerated applications. The CUDA Toolkit includes GPU-accelerated libraries, a compiler, development tools and the CUDA runtime.<br>
														4.2.5 Tensorflow:<br>
														TensorFlow is an open-source library for fast numerical computing. It was created and is maintained by Google and released under the Apache 2.0 open source license. The API is nominally for the Python programming language.<br>
														The TensorFlow Object Counting API is an open-source framework built on top of TensorFlow and Keras that makes it easy to develop object counting systems.
														4.2.6 Python:<br>
														For Installation of TensorFlow, we need  Python SciPy environment. TensorFlow works with Python 2.7 and Python 3.3+. For Our project, we installed python<br> 3.3 <br>
														Python is a general-purpose programming language started by Guido van Rossum that became very popular very quickly, mainly because of its simplicity and code readability. It enables the programmer to express ideas in fewer lines of code without reducing readability.<br>




														4.2.7 Open CV:<br>
														Open CV (Open source computer vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Open CV supports a wide variety of programming languages such as C++, Python, Java, etc., and is available on different platforms including Windows. Open CV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems.
														Open CV-Python makes use of Numpy, which is a highly optimized library for numerical operations with a MATLAB-style syntax. All the Open CV array structures are converted to and from Numpy arrays. This also makes it easier to integrate with other libraries that use Numpy such as SciPy and Matplotlib.<br>

														Conclution:<br>It has been successfully proven through the prototype that computer vision-based vehicle counting system works in its unique way. The vehicle detection will increase with more dataset training to the machine. The CCTV installed by DMP gives us the footage; we use it to gather traffic data and provide it to the police so that they can use it. Moreover, this system will also help civil engineers to gather data on traffic load while building or repairing roads.<br>

														Installation of CCTV cameras to monitor and provide security is a very common process now a day. So what if we not only use those cameras to monitor but also explore more use of those cameras? This was the whole thing to help our traffic police to solve the traffic jam. Our target was to create something helpful in this field at the minimum cost that we have done in this project.
