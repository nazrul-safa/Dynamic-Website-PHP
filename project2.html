	                                                <h2><u>Project Report</u></h2>
	                                               	<p>
													1.Introduction:<br>

													1.1 -Sometimes we need to deliver a common message to many persons in office, Educational institute and other platforms. It’s very time consuming and costly to call individually. That’s why we use Asterisk,Elastix,Asterisk Now,Isabel,Free-PBX,Distro,PBX in Flash ,Trixbox  server to communicate a large number of people at the same time. Asterisk is a software that turns an ordinary computer into communication server and in our project we will customize it. <br>
													1.2- Many businesses today are beginning to realize just how advantageous IP (internet protocol) technology is when it comes to facilitating communications. By using internet-based systems, organizations are able to build a single infrastructure that supports both their voice and data communications needs.<br>
													1.3-IP phone systems use voice over internet protocol (VoIP) technology for placing and conducting telephone calls. Through IP technology, businesses are able to make their telephone and computer networks work together to overcome the limits previously set by traditional phone systems. In other words, organizations today have the option of not being bound to the limitations of telephone networks. What the service providers were able to offer in the past can now be achieved by the right internet-based technologies <br>

													2.Problem Statement:<br>

													2.1 -Time consuming:<br>
													If someone have to communicate with thousands of people then it’s very much time consuming to contact with everyone and in many cases it’s almost impossible.<br>
													2.2 - Costly:<br>
													When we have to call many people by cellular network it becomes too costly which is not a positive side for any institution.<br>
													2.3 - Not flexible:<br>
													In business we have to stay connected with customers. In this process it’s not flexible to contact with customers. As a business owner or marketer, you don’t want your sales teams wasting time cold calling from a list of unqualified leads. 
													Moreover, it cannot give us real time updates as we have to call individuals.<br>
													3.Proposed Solution:<br>
													we want to develop an unified communications server software that brings together IP PBX, email, IM, faxing and collaboration functionality. It has a Web interface and includes capabilities such as a beneficial commercial  software with predictive dialling.<br>


													3.1 State the solution with features:<br>

													Now here are some features that we wanted to implement in our project.<br>

													1. PBX network setup 
													2. Dialplan.
													3. Inbound Calls.
													4. Outbound Calls
													5. Voicemail.
													6. Call distribution 
													7. SIP
													8. Soft-Phone.<br>


													1.PBX network setup:  (Private Branch Exchange) - A telephone exchange that serves a particular business or office, as opposed to one that a common carrier or telephone company operates for many businesses or for the general public. The PBX software is what gets installed on your server to act as the brains of your local phone network. It allows you to do everything  you can 
													imagine with your phone system. We are using the Elastix PBX system with Free PBX as the user<br>
													4.Voicemail:<br>
													We can declare the mailbox in the default mailbox context – [default] or create others. Note that the mailbox contexts and those in extensions.conf have no relation in between. They are just some kind of separators in two different files.
													The command looks like this: <br>
													mailbox_number => password, name, email
													mailbox_number is the number you use in extension.conf for VoiceMail() command and to register a user in sip.conf or iax.conf
													password is the pass used to register a user in sip.conf or iax.conf
													name is the name which to be associated with the mailbox
													email is where a notification for the voicemail will come.<br>

													6. Call distribution ACD (Automatic Call Distributor) - A device or system that distributes incoming calls to a specific group of terminals that agents use. It is often part of a computer telephony integration (CTI) system.<br>
													7. SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) - A signalling protocol, widely used for controlling multimedia communication sessions such as voice and video calls over Internet Protocol (IP). SIP adoption amongst hardware and software vendors continues to expand.<br>
													8. Soft-phone: in this case we can use different software like as a soft-phones.we can use 3CX or X-Lite  software for simulation <br>
													9. Conclusion:  <br>
													Finally we want to conclude that VoIP and Telephony based on IP, are finally bringing voice into users network, just like all the other applications that we have been using for years, such as email, databases, and instant messaging.  PBX manufacturers have moved into IP communications and are now using protocols that can communicate and integrate with other existing applications.In addition to taking advantage of lower cost VoIP routing, purchasing your own IP-PBX lowers costs over time.  When using hosted VoIP the initial costs are most likely lower, but monthly subscription costs are ongoing and higher over time when compared to an IP-PBX.   An business owned IP-PBX will usually result in lower averaged monthly operating costs especially for systems with a higher number of users.
